Created on Tue May 23 15:45:23 2023

folder to hold derivatives and metrics computed from the gmax/TPD
sectionals and GPS points data.

each file in here will be geared towards slightly different things
based on this data.

older metrics likely to stay in feeds/utils.py for compatibility
with applications that already import functions from there, but will
be imported into here as well and applications should be edited to import
them from this file as the functions are liable to be removed from
feeds/utils.py
